<P>With NetPerSec you can select between two icons to display in the system tray, a bar graph and a histogram graph.</P>

<P><B>Bar graph icon  </B></P>

<P>The bar graph icon consists of two panels; the left panel is used when sending data and the right panel when receiving data. The height of the bars will change according to the rate in which the data is being transferred.    The taller the bar, the faster your current connection is based upon your average data throughput.  You may change the colors displayed in the icon using the <A HREF="netp15ia.htm">Display Tab</A>.</P>

<P><B>Histogram icon  </B></P>

<P>The Histogram icon displays the most recent samples of data transmission rates.  Samples are comprised of statistics that NetPerSec collects periodically from your network.  For example, if you have configured NetPerSec to monitor your connection once per second, then the sample will consist of a 'snapshot' of network activity that has occurred during a one second interval.</P>

<P>The top half of the icon indicates received data and the lower half indicates sent data. Taller bars in the graph indicate faster transmission rates.   The graph is automatically scaled using the last 14 samples. </P>

<P>Note that icons in the system tray are limited to a size of 16x16 pixels.  In systems that use high display resolutions the histogram icon may be difficult to see and you may wish to use the bar graph icon instead.  Also, because of this size limitation, the histogram displayed within the icon will not exactly mirror the graph displayed in the <A HREF="netp3iua.htm">Graph tab</A>. The Graph tab is capable of rendering greater detail over a longer period of time.</P>
