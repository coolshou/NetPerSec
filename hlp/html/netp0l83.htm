<H2><I>Windows NT 4</I></H2>

<P>If you are using Windows NT 4 it is suggested that you install service pack 4 or higher.   Older versions of NT contain a bug in the SNMP interface which result in memory leaks. </P>

<H2><I>Windows 95</I></H2>

<P>If you are using Windows 95 you must have the Winsock v2.0 update and the Dialup Networking Upgrade installed.  Both of these updates may be downloaded from <U>http://www.microsoft.com/windows95/downloads/</U>.</P>

<H2><I>Troubleshooting</I></H2>

<P>If you receive an error message when starting NetPerSec, or if NetPerSec does not seem to be reporting network statistics, please verify the following.    NetPerSec relies on two files in your system in order to work -- INETMIB1.DLL and SNMPAPI.DLL.  Both of these files must reside in the Windows folder if you are running Windows 9.x, or in the System32 folder if you are running Window NT/2000.  Please verify that these files are present and do not exist in other folders such as C:\Windows\System or C:\WinNT.  If you find duplicates of these files outside of the proper folders you will need to delete them to the Recycle Bin and restart your system.</P>

<P>Certain combinations of network interfaces and drivers may cause NetPerSec to report double or more amounts for the data actually transferred.   Please see the <I>Network Interface</I> section under the <A HREF="netp4j36.htm">Options tab</A> for details on how to correct this problem.</P>
