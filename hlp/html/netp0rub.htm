<P>How fast is your Internet connection, really?  Different types of connections promise different communication speeds, but is this what you're actually getting?  NetPerSec, lets you check your connection speed in real time.  Its dynamic tray icon shows send and receive activity with a bar graph or a histogram.  You can also view current and average send and receive speeds in a configurable, graphical display. </P>

<P>NetPerSec configures itself automatically and will detect your current access medium to the Internet -- modem or network interface card.  You can start and stop NetPerSec at any time and do not need to restart your Internet connection.  NetPerSec also monitors all TCP/IP activity whether it is over the Internet or on an internal LAN, or WAN, network.</P>

<P>NetPerSec runs under-- Windows 9x, Windows ME, Windows NT, and Windows 2000.  Please see the <A HREF="netp0l83.htm">Requirements</A> section for details.</P>
